1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

	- Don't allow SSH passwords use private key authentication
	- Don't listen on every interface
	- set up strong passwords/ passphrases for ssh users and keys
	- create a network interface for ssh which is different to the interface you serve requests
	- disable openssh server on the laptops and desktops
	- limit max authentication attempts
	- Enable login notifications over email 



2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

	- Sensitve data should be encrypted with - AWS customer keys.  
	- Multi factor authentication and strong passwords.
